filesec [-devh] [-D DBGVAL] [-p PASSFILE] [-s] infile outfilels

to run with extra credit do:
make clean
make extracredit=1

DEBUG VALUES:
0x10 : print args to functions (MUST ALSO INCLUDE 0x01 | 0x02 | 0x04)
0x20 : print retvals from functions (MUST ALSO INCLUDE 0x01 | 0x02 | 0x04)

Symmetric Encryption and Decryption
Source: https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/EVP_Symmetric_Encryption_and_Decryption
Used as a guide for encryption and decryption. Encrypt & decrypt functions 
are similiar, calls to those functions are different. 

INCLUDED:
shell_scripts folder: a series of test /bin/sh shell scripts to test that my program runs
    as expected
    test1.sh, test2.sh(incomplete), test3.sh
    run scripts by doing 'make tests'
files folder: has in.txt, out.txt and pass.txt
    in.txt has some sample input
    pass.txt contains a password and a newline. Password is from [0] to [\n]
    pass2.txt contains a different password from pass.txt
Extra Credit: 
    ONLY ACTIVE WHEN 'make extracredit=1' HAS BEEN DONE
    [A] - an option [-s] (safe) which will cause the program to prompt for
    the user password twice. If the passwords didn't match, abort with an appropriate
    error.
    [B] - an option [i] which will utilize the Initialization Vector (IV)
        - -i flag is working as expected (only on extracredit mode) but issues with encrytion/decryption so I disabled it 
            from modifying the actual iv value.
NOTES:
    Some functions have been omitted from the ARGS/RET Debug options because 
    I deemed them unnecessary.
    In addition to omitting some unnecessary calls from the Debugs, some may have been
    looked over because of the excessive amount of debug statements. 

to print my debug statements do: (some removed before submission)
make clean
make debug
