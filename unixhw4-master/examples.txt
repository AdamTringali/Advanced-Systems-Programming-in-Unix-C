# example of adding a job of program du with arguments -sh and /usr (if du completes too fast, use sleep)
# syntax for argv is : argv=program,arg1,arg2
# syntax for envp is : envp=variable-value,variable2-value2

add argv=du,-sh,/usr envp=myVar-12,myVar2-2121

list

# if the du program is still running, lets try to suspend it (expecting the job number to be 1)

susp 1

list

# lets resume the du program using the continue command

cont 1

list

# lets run du program again and kill it instead

add argv=du,-sh,/usr

list

kill 2

list

# we should see job 2 is stopped

# lets test other programs

add argv=ps,-l
add argv=ls,-l
add argv=cd,123
add argv=ps,aux

# now lets test to run concurrent jobs

add argv=sleep,100
add argv=sleep,100
add argv=sleep,100
add argv=sleep,100

# the last sleep program should not be unable to added

# lets change priority of sleep program

nice (insert job num of sleep program) 10

list

# verifies that priority changed

add argv=ps,-l
