Introduction
We have set up limited lab facilities for use by registered class students during the semester. The lab's machines are accessible only remotely and via a secure shell. Details are provided below. Note that the procedures we describe here will be updated and adjusted as needed throughout the semester.
There are restrictions on the use of the Lab facilities:

Only registered users may use it.
Auditors cannot use the lab.
Access to the lab requires SSH. If you are running on a host that does not have SSH installed (for example on your MS Windows laptop from your dorm), then download a commercial one from DoIT, and then install it; alternatively, you can get a freely available version called Putty.
Lab use is for class work only and only for this class. DON'T USE THIS ACCOUNT FOR YOUR OTHER CLASSWORK OF ANY OTHER CLASS. Students caught using this account for other classes will have their accounts turned off and all files related to other classes deleted.
People caught "hacking", cheating, or abusing the resources will be denied access to the facilities and be handled in accordance to the university's policies on academic dishonesty and computer use.
The lab facilities are limited. Start your homework early! Don't wait until the last minute. The more people compile code all at once, the slower the lab facilities will be. Vary your time of work: some people prefer day-time work, some like to work late at night, some over the weekends. Check who else is on your system (by running /usr/bin/w) and what the load is (using /usr/bin/uptime).
