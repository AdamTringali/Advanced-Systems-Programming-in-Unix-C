CSE-376 (Spring 2020) Homework Assignment #1

filesec [-devh] [-D DBGVAL] [-p PASSFILE] [-s] infile outfile


to run with extra credit do:
make clean
make extracredit=1

DEBUG VALUES:
0x10 : print args to functions (MUST ALSO INCLUDE 0x01 | 0x02 | 0x04)
0x20 : print retvals from functions (MUST ALSO INCLUDE 0x01 | 0x02 | 0x04)

Symmetric Encryption and Decryption
Source: https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/EVP_Symmetric_Encryption_and_Decryption
Used as a guide for encryption and decryption. Encrypt & decrypt functions 
are similiar, calls to those functions are different. 

INCLUDED:
files folder: has in.txt, out.txt and pass.txt
    in.txt has some sample input
    pass.txt contains a password and a newline. Password is from [0] to [\n]
    pass2.txt contains a different password from pass.txt
Extra Credit: 
    [A] - an option [-s] (safe) which will cause the program to prompt for
    the user password twice. If the passwords didn't match, abort with an appropriate
    error.
NOTES:
    Some functions have been omitted from the ARGS/RET Debug options because 
    I deemed them unnecessary.
    In addition to omitting some unnecessary calls from the Debugs, some may have been
    looked over because of the excessive amount of debug statements. 

to print my debug statements do:
make clean
make debug
